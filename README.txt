Instantly post reviews to your blog WHILE browsing Amazon!

== Description ==

Many affiliate plugins work exclusively on the administration section of your self-hosted WordPress site ("Dashboard"). Let's face it &ndash; this method of creating reviews is boring, error-prone and counter-intuitive. And it feels like work...

To counter that, we have developed AffiGet. 

With AffiGet, you can fully utilize all the navigation and recommendation features provided by Amazon, to find a product that might be of interest to your readers, and "bookmark" as many of them as you like, without ever losing your navigation trail or interrupting your train of thought. *No other affiliate WordPress plugin provides such a streamlined and natural experience!*

Note, however, that this is NOT a "make quick money online" kind of a plugin. It was designed with a dedicated blogger/curator in mind. We hope AffiGet will become an indispensable tool you use to grow your niche site or your magazine-style curated product catalog.

AffiGet utilizes the official Amazon Product Advertising API to fetch most of the publicly available product details, including editorial description, all images, exact pricing information, etc. No "page scrapping" is involved, therefore all product details are always correct and up-to-date. All the links referring your site's visitors back to Amazon will be embellished with your affiliate tag. As usual, you will get 4-10% commissions from all the qualifying purchases they make there.

In order for this plugin to work, you have to provide the credentials for your [Amazon Associates](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/ "Join now!") account (which is free and relatively easy to get).

= AffiGet Pro =
A more advanced version of this plugin is nearly finished. If you want to participate in a BETA test, please subscribe to our launch list on [AffiGet.com](http://affiget.com).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'affiget-mini' folder to the /wp-content/plugins directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to the AffiGet Settings page in WordPress dashboard: 
	* input your *Amazon Associates* credentials;
	* drag the *Afg+ button* to your Bookmarklets toolbar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change my reviews once they are created? =
Absolutely! AffiGet pre-populates reviews with the available product data, but you can open it for editing and change it to your liking by modifying any of the regular post elements (like title, slug, excerpt, featured image, tags/categories, publishing date, post status, comment status, etc.). In addition to that, you will see elements specific to AffiGet reviews (main review text, pricing details, review conclusion, call-to-action button). For your convenience, the rating stars element and the product attributes table are even *front-end editable*!    

= Will AffiGet work with my WordPress theme? =
Yes! AffiGet has been developed to work with any WordPress installation. You might be required to add some custom styling for the layouts to appear correctly should your theme have CSS code that conflicts. For starters we’ve made it fully compatible with the default WordPress themes.

= What if I want a more control over how my review is presented? =
Consider upgrading to [AffiGet Pro](http://affiget.com/ "Upgrade today!") -- a premium version of this plugin will be made available shortly. It is designed to work with the free and wildly popular drag & drop layout management plugin [Page Builder by SiteOrigin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/siteorigin-panels/ "Install now!").
